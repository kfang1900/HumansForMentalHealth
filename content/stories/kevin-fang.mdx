“Bulldog! Bulldog! Bow-wow-wow, Eli Yale!”

Tears flooded my eyes as the time-honored fight song blared through my admissions portal. The child in me, who was put in ESL because he struggled to read a picture book, still couldn’t believe I had made it to Yale’s Class of 2023.

Just a year earlier, I was sitting across my psychiatrist's blank stare. I told him about my childhood: being bullied for my accent, surviving on food stamps with my dad, crying alone on the flight home from Mom’s every summer. My stepmother came into my life when I was eleven. I gave her all my love, but after my sister was born she was no longer interested in me. During my senior year, she became emotionally abusive.

For months on end, she would pretend I didn’t exist. I skipped family dinners, eating the leftovers after everyone went to bed. My mental health deteriorated, and soon, I was failing all my classes. I was asked to meet my high school’s 504 coordinator where I was condescendingly lectured on how to take better notes. I was given the option to drop my AP courseload to the honors level, but Yale’s policy dictated I needed their approval before any course changes.

I knew that would only raise their concerns, so I grit my teeth and pushed through OCD-fueled nights with four hours of sleep and debilitating panic attacks onstage during pianissimo endings. I was too traumatized to study at home, so every day after class my dad drove me to our local Starbucks. Somehow miraculously, juggling makeup exams with biweekly therapy sessions, I managed to finish my final semester with a mix of As and Bs — I was proud.

Summer finally arrived and I was finally able to focus on my mental health. I visited family in China with my mom and bonded over lost time. Near the end of our trip, my dad called with a message from Margit Dahl, Director of Undergraduate Admissions. She was disappointed with my drop in academic performance and asked for an explanation. I was scared to disclose my struggle with depression, but I wanted to be honest. I told her about my mental health struggles, my panic attacks on stage, even my grandfather’s leukemia diagnosis — everything. I stressed that I had made huge strides toward my recovery, that my psychiatrist believed I was ready for college.

She was not convinced, even citing the timing of my email, “2:55 AM Texas time,” as proof that I was “not yet back to a normal sleep schedule” — I was on the other side of the globe. She strongly recommended I take a year off to focus on my recovery but said, “This is not an order; in the end, it is your decision.” Both my psychiatrist and therapist, who understood my illness better than her, feared a gap year could be harmful, and I politely declined. I felt excited and ready.
