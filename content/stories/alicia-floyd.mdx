Alicia is an internal medicine physician working on inpatient medical floors and ICUs in the midwest. She struggled with depression while in college and was hospitalized twice at Yale Psychiatric Hospital, withdrawing once. She completed her pre-medical coursework at Columbia and graduated from Icahn Mount Sinai School of Medicine in 2011. She is proud to be one of the co-founding members of Elis for Rachael and gratified to see progress to Yaleâ€™s mental health policies as a result of the September 2023 settlement, though much work remains. Hear some words of encouragement from Alicia to current students.
